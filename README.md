# jsPsych plugins

Plugins for jsPsych experiment scripts. Some are just tweaks of existing plugins (see jspsych.org); others are custom. 

Several require libraries like P5.js, D3.js or jquery to be loaded. 

Currently, they are poorly commented as I've just been using them for my own experiments. If anyone wishes to use a particular script, let me know and I'll make an effort to add comments.
